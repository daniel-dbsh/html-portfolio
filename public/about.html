<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Daniel Salazar, and I'm passionate about web development and digital design. Born and raised in a city where technology thrives, I've always been fascinated by how websites work and the impact they have on our daily lives.</p>

<p>After completing my degree in Computer Science, I decided to focus my career on creating meaningful and user-friendly digital experiences. Over the years, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I continue to explore new technologies to stay at the forefront of the web development field.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking in the mountains, reading science fiction novels, or experimenting with digital photography. I believe in lifelong learning and am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow.</p>

<p>Through my work, I strive to build websites that not only look great but also provide a seamless user experience. I'm excited about the future of web development and am looking forward to contributing to innovative projects that make a difference.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a> if you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaboration opportunities.</p>
